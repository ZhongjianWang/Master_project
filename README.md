# Real-time events detection on smartphone -- a real-time Classification using Stacking Ensemble Machine Learning With Python: Project Overview
Using two different types of sensors on smartphone (magnetic filed sensor and microphone), we build two models to predict result. We optimised stacking ensemble machine learning algorithm with our scenario and let two sensors helo each other get the best prediction. Our goal is as following:
* get access to smartphone sensors
* collect audio files and magnetic field data
* improve the single data source machine learning module with reference of magnetic field data
* realtime data collecting and processing
* send feedback from server and show realtime event predicts on the smartphone

## Code and Resources Used
**Python version**: 3.7

**Packages**: pandas,numpy,sklearn,matplotlib,flask,tensorflow2.0,keras

**CNN**: Large parts of the CNN code are based on  https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/23645648

**SVM**: The feature extraction parts of the audio classification are based on https://github.com/mtobeiyf/audio-classification
